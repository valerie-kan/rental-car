Rental Car is a website that allows the user to choose a car for rent. It consists of 3 pages:

- Home Page with a catalog button which leads user to page where all cars are shown
- Catalog page with all available cars and filtration by brand, price per hour and mileage
- Car details page with all info about selected car and form for rent.

All that is needed to book a car is just to enter details in the form on the car details page and the car will be booked. Also there is an option to click on a ![](https://github.com/valerie-kan/rental-car/blob/main/src/assets/heart.svg) button to add a car to favourites.

The web-app is adapted for all screen sizes.
