I have just finished an IT course and this is my first project after studing. It's called Rental Car.

Rental Car is a website that allows the user to choose a car for rent. It consists of 3 pages:

- Home Page with a catalog button which leads the user to page where all cars are shown
- Catalog page with all available cars
- Car details page with all info about selected car and form for rent it.

All that is needed to book a car is just to enter user details in the form on the car details page and comment(optional) and the car will be booked.

If the user already knows which car they want, there are filters on Catalog page. So user just enters the brand of the car or price or mileage and the website shows all cars available acoording to the search parameters.
